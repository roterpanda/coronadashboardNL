# Coronavirus Dashboard Netherlands

A simple dashboard showing the lastest [RIVM data](https://data.rivm.nl/geonetwork/srv/dut/catalog.search#/metadata/1c0fcd57-1102-4620-9cfa-441e93ea5604) on the spread of the coronavirus in the Netherlands. The data gets updated once a day, usually shortly after 2pm Amsterdam time.

### Disclaimer
I do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy of the data displayed. Day by day data corrections occur i.e. the dashboard can show negative values.
